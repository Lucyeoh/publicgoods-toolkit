# Policy

TBD: Things to cover in the introduction:

  - Commercial use and re-use (wasn't in original outline, but should
    be represented in this section).

  - Importance of distinguishing between trademarks, copyrights, and
    patents.

## Security

TBD: Security policy comes from threat modeling, risk assessment, and
cost/benefit analysis.  In Security, distinguish what's discussed in
this section from what's discussed in the "Security" subsection in
Adoptability.

## Data Privacy

connections to security; all the policy in the world doesn't help you
without technical security.  Note connection to vendor SLA (and to
liability).

### GDPR
